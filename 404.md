#Ooops......

You stumbled upon an dead URL at HonestIllusion.com

I've recently changed blogging host & platform  & other stuff, so a lot of old URL don't  work any more.

#But DONT Panic!

The articles are still here ! (Many even have the typos fixed!)

If the link was in the form:

http://honestillusion.com/blogs/blog_0/archive/2008/01/15/article-name-here.aspx

try changing it to:

http://honestillusion.com/blog/2008/01/15/article-name-here.html

 * "blogs" to "blog"
 * Delete "blog_0/archive/"
 * "aspx" to "html"
 
##If that doesn't work, try the [archive](archives.html).
