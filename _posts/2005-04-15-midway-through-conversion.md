Right now, honestillusion.com is the old .Text blog<

[www.honestillusion.com](http://www.honestillusion.com) is the new CommunityServer blog.

**UPDATE (25-Apr-2013)**: It does seem a bit odd to be converting this message from HTML to MarkDown to move the blog from CommunityServer to GitHub pages.
