I've noticed that the video, in my downloads section, of my friend lighting a bonfire in his backyard has been downloaded some 800 times.  So, I figured I'd upload the video of him firing off his cannon, but this time I put it up on YouTube.  Funny thing -- so far no one has watched it.   I guess my blog really is an important way of getting the word out.

And while we are on the subject, I also put up a video of another interesting party event: Erin Bowling.
