<p>I'm actually writing this on August 21st.  However, shortly after I complete this, I'm going the futz around with the database so that it appears to have been written a bit earlier in the month.  The reason being that starting back in Febraury, I began writing articles that I'd planned on putting in a blog, I just didn't expect it would take me this long to actual get one going. </p>
<p>Now, it wouldn't make much sense to post them all today (21-Aug), but it would make even less sense to redate them so they appear on the date they were written -- scattering a handful of them over six months.   So, I compromised, and plan on scattering them over one month, so that way you can get the full feeling of the beginning of this blog --- all of one page.</p>
