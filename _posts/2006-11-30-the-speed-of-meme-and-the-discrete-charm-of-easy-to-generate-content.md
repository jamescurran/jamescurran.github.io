I hate posts which are just links to other pages (which is actually not true --- I **do** like reading other people's blogs which are just links --- I just think it's cheating when I do it)
But [this site](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/measuring_the_s.html)  has a built in reason to blog a link to it (He's trying to measure how fast the links spread), and I gives me a reason to write a new blog entry without have to think too much.

Now, it's important that you click through to his site, so that this site is recorded as linking to that one.  You don't have to actually read that page (which is pretty much for the best, as he talks a lot without saying much)
