title: ESTAFest 2005, Day 1
---
<P>OK, so I don't write a message for 6 months. But you can always count on a good ESTA Festival to get me talking.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This year it is being held in Delaware -- just about the same length of drive as the Maryland one last year (Hate to think where their gonna send us next year --- New York or Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>After a rather uneventful drive down, and a quick check in to the hotel, I wasted about 20 minutes driving around trying to find the theater.&nbsp; I was trying to get there in time for a workshop at 3:30.&nbsp; I ended up getting there about 3:50 ( which was actually pretty good time since I left home at 12:50).&nbsp; Not that it mattered --- the schedule I was looked at was from last year.&nbsp; There apparently aren't any workshops this year.</P>
<P>So, I hung around 'til 5:00pm, when there was a reception -- free food, but a cash bar (including soda for a buck each).&nbsp; And, other than some quiche, the food was all meat, which I don't eat on Fridays.&nbsp; After a while, I strolled around the corner, and got a slice of pizza.</P>
<P>At 7PM, the theater stuff actually started.&nbsp; As an "opening act",&nbsp; they has a Dame Edna impersonator, who joked about theater, the states represented and such for about twenty minutes.&nbsp; Then, finally, was the first show of the festival --- Triple Threat (of Cherry Hill) performing "Proof" quite nicely cut down to the required hour.&nbsp; The first adjudicator just raved about it.&nbsp; The next two were quite positive, even if they didn't gush quite as much as the first.</P>
<P>After them, a troupe from Pennsylvania present 4 bits from "Febraury 14 and other Plays" --- Hard to describe them without giving away too many of the surprises in the stories.&nbsp; All four were two character piece for a man &amp; woman (although one was changed to two men --- I didn't learn that until after seeing it; it would probably seem very different with that character as a woman).&nbsp; The adjudicators, while still positive, were a bit more restrained this time.&nbsp; So, the early line is, New Jersey is leading....</P>
