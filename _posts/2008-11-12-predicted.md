Way back into March, my best friend Chris and I made our predictions for the [presidential election]({% post_url 2008-03-25-predictions%}).  Since the election is now over (mostly), it's time to review have well we did:
 
   | | Chris's Prediction|James's Prediction|Actual Results
   |-|-------------------|------------------|--------------
   President|McCain|The democrat|Obama
   States won by Democratic nominee| 14|20|27
   Senate seats won by Dems|  0|+4|+6 (maybe +9)
   House of Representatives|-8|+10|+23
   Governors won by Dems|-2|+2|+1
 
 So, in every category, I was closer, and except for governors, even I was too pessimistic.
