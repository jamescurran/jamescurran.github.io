  <P>The real MVP summit starts tomorrow (The first bus leave the hotel at 6:30!!), but today they had the registration at the Washisngton State Cenvention Center.  We went to one room, where they looked up our names, and handed as a bag, and then we went upstairs to a different hall, where there was food and a lot of kiosks where Microsoft showed off some of their new stuff.</P>
<P>So, let's get to the important part --- What was the swag?</P>
<P>In the bag was a three ring binder, fill with agenda details customized to me; an MVP-logoed Pen; an MVP-logoed travel clock/lcd calendar/calculator, and an MVP-logoed bowling shirt (I now have enough MVP-logoed shirts to where one throughout my stay in Seattle).  When we got to the expo hall, one kiosk was handing out logoed “Jelly Cell Mate” pads (”magically hold a cell phone, pda ... to your dash without magnets or adhesivies”, and another (if you signed a form) gave out an “MVP Toolkit”: A nice pen, a penlight flashlight, and a tire pressure guage, all in a hard-shell case.</P>
