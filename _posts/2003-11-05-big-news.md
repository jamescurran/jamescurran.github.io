Yesterday, I got an offer for a new job, and immediately resigned from my current one.  Hopefully, this will cut down on conversations which start like this (which has been the norm for my over the past year):

**Other Person:** "Hi, James, so what's up?"

**Me:** "Well, I hate my job, but what else is new?"

There is a very small raise involved -- probably equal to what I would have gotten in January anyway, and no  more bonus.  On the other hand, the new place has a standard 9-5 schedule, as opposed to my current job's 8-6, so the hourly rate is way up.
