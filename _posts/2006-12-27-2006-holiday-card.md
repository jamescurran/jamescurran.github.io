  For those of you who weren't on my Christmas card list (or whose name fell after the point where I ran out of envelopes), my Christmas card for 2006 is available [here (785K PDF)](/files/ChristmasCard2006.PDF).  Download it, print it out (one 8 1/2 x 11 page), fold it into quarters, then open and enjoy the card.
