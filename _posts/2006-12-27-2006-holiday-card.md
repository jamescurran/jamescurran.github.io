  <p>For those of you who weren't on my Christmas card list (or whose name fell after the point where I ran out of envelopes), my Christmas card for 2006 is available <a href="http://honestillusion.com/files/folders/misc/entry4190.aspx">here (785K PDF).</a>  Download it, print it out (one 8 1/2 x 11 page), fold it into quarters, then open and enjoy the card.</p>
