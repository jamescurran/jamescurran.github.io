  <p>The folks at Dev102.com are offering weekly programming challenges, where they offer questions, and let bloggers post about them.  I meant to write an answer for last week, but never got around to it.  Just as well -- my answer would have been wrong.  SO, let's move on to <a href="http://www.dev102.com/2008/05/19/a-programming-job-interview-challenge-4/">this week's</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>How would you implement the following method: Foo(7) == 17 and Foo(17) == 7. Any other input to that method is not defined so you can return anything you want. Just follow those rules:</em></p>    <ul>     <li><em>Conditional statements (if, switch, ...) are not allowed. </em></li>      <li><em>Usage of containers (hash tables, arrays, ...) are not allowed. </em></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>My first thought was, since we can't use conditional statements, to use conditional <em>expressions</em> instead:</p>  <p><font face="Courier New">int foo(int n)      <br />{      <br />    return (n==7)   17 : (n==17)   7 : n;      <br />} </font></p>  <p> </p>  <p>But clearly, that is just cheating.  (And, besides, it turns out, it's not the best solution).</p>  <p>My next attempt was to use subtraction to create factors of zero.</p>  <p><font face="Courier New">int foo(int n)      <br />{      <br />    return n + (10 * (n-17) * (n-6)) + (-10 * (n-16) * (n-7))  ;      <br />} </font></p>  <p>There may be a formula in there that works, but that one doesn't, and before I found it, I stumble upon the <em>correct </em>solution, which was just sitting there staring me in the face:</p>  <p><font face="Courier New">int foo(int n)      <br />{      <br />    return 24-n;      <br />} </font></p>  <p><font face="Courier New"></font></p>  <p>Yep, it's just that simple.</p>
