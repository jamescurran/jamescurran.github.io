  <p>After many months to checking out the new projects on CodePlex almost daily, it's finally time for me to create one.  </p> <p> </p> <p>As you might know, I also run the website, NJTheater.com.  Written about 10 years ago, all in classic ASP, it has a forum section -- which uses the open source Snitz Forum package.</p> <p>Over the years, the membership has grown (over 3000 registered users), and I started to use the forum membership database, to manage authorization in other others of the website.</p> <p>Now ASP.Net v2 came out, with it's built in Authentication/Authorization system, I thought "That's exactly what I need for my website" --- except it used a completely different db schema then the one I already had (and each hashed the passwords in different ways, so no conversion from one to the other was possible).</p> <p>Fortunately, the membership system was built on using the Provider model, so I just had to create a Membership provider which fitted the interface, but used the existing membership database.   <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SnitzMember" target="_blank">SnitzMember</a> is the provider.</p> <p> </p> <p>Also, you may have noticed that I referred to this as my <em>first</em> CodePlex project.  Well, you may have also noticed that I referred to NJTheater.com as 10 years old, and written in Classic ASP.  Stay Tuned.</p>
