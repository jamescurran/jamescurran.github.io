<P>OK, now that I've trashed &#8220;Joshua&#8221;, I might as well discuss the other books in the book club this year.  (Note, the club is run by St Valentines Roman Catholic Church is Bloomfield, NJ, so you might sense a theme in them).</P>

This is the memiors of a boy, who started having seizures in grammer school and thought they were caused by him being possessed by the devil.  It's a fascinating story on how he dealt with it, and kept is a secret throughout grammer school &amp; high school.  It was especially interesting to me, as I am just about the same age as the author, so all the cultural reference matched to my experiences.  The ultimate problem is that since it's a true story, the story arc is limited to what actually happened, so we're left with a rather weak ending.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P><IFRAME style="FLOAT: left" marginWidth=0 marginHeight=0 src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm o=1&amp;l=as1&amp;f=ifr&amp;t=njtheatercom-20&amp;dev-t=D68HUNXKLHS4J&amp;p=8&amp;asins=0385504535&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank" frameBorder=0 width=120 scrolling=no height=240><MAP NAME="boxmap-p8"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="14, 200, 103, 207" HREF="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html o=1" ><AREA COORDS="0,0,10000,10000" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/njtheatercom-20" ></MAP><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/120x240.gif" width="120" height="240" border="0" usemap="#boxmap-p8" alt="Shop at Amazon.com"></IFRAME>
<P> Next was <EM>Conclave, </EM>by John L. Allen, Jr.  I really like this book, though it's an limited taste.  It's the inside story of the politics involved in choosing the next pope, so it'll appeal to Catholics we can't get enough politics merely in the Bush/Kerry Race.</P>

This is truly a great book, though by now, you probably don't need me to tell you about it.   It's a well-plotted tale, that's meaningful without ever being saccrine.  It's pretty much everything that &#8220;Joshua and the City&#8220; is not.  It's characters act like real people, with real emotions and motivations. </P>
