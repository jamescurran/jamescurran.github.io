I'm working on this really big project, which I'll be writing on shortly, but in the meantime, I haven't posted in a while, and there's got to be someone out there just waiting with bated breath for my next message, so I thought I'd throw out a quickie:  Tech Interview Standard BuzzFuzz in one C# LINQ statement:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jamescurran/6390523.js">   </script>

You'll note that this handles the correct rules of the game ("Replace all number divisible by 7 ***or containing 7***, with '*Fuzz*'")

If my other project continues to drone on before being blog-able, I'll write up my version of Buzz-Fuzz following the SOLID principles.
