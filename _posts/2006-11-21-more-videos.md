Music first.  The Church of Stop Shopping Gospel Choir singing "Not For Sale"</p> <p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CD9x4IrnJgY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now the talking heads.  We start with two from Rep Pascrell.

Next, we toss in one by Rep Payne (He's not actually my congressman --- That's Pascrell-- but he's still pretty cool)
