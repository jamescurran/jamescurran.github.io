Ok, in this selection we've got politians *and* Rev Billy. One or the other is not going to forgive me.

Music first.  The Church of Stop Shopping Gospel Choir singing "Not For Sale"</p> <p>[YouTube:CD9x4IrnJgY]

Next, we toss in one by Rep Payne (He's not actually my congressman --- That's Pascrell-- but he's still pretty cool)
