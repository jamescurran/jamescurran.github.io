  <p>I've come within a few hours of letting the entire month of April go by without post even one blog entry.  So, where the heck have I been?</p> <p>First off, on the 9th, I started a new job.  I'm now back to working in NYC, and back to working on C#, after a seven month deversion into C++ in New Jersey.</p> <p>I'm now working with WCF, so hopefully, after I figure out exactly what I doing, I'll have some fun thoughts to share with my vast reading audience.</p>
