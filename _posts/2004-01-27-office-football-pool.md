    title: Office Football pool
    ---
<P>Like pretty much every office in the country, mine has a pool of the Superbowl.&nbsp; Since we don't have enough employee to fill 100 boxes, each person got four combinations.&nbsp; Mine are&nbsp;<FONT face=Arial size=2> 6-0, 5-0, 1-7, 2-3. (Patriot's scores listed first).&nbsp; So, given that, here my prediction for the game:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1st Quarter : Patriots score a touchdown, but no extra point. Panther do not score (6-0)<BR>2nd Quarter : Patriots score another touchdown, but without an&nbsp;extra point. Panther score a field goal (12-3)<BR>3rd Quarter : Patriots a field goal, Panthers score a touchdown with an extra point (15-10)<BR>4th Quarter : Patriots score yet another touchdown without an&nbsp;extra point, Pather score a TD with an extra point (21-17)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>And I take the entire pot.......</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(Subtitling for those unfamilar for American Football:&nbsp; Football has a number of different ways to score points with the two most important ones being a touchdown (running or throwing the ball to a receiver, in the endzone; worth 6 points), and a field goal (kicking the ball through the posts; worth 3 points).&nbsp; After a touchdown, the team may try for an &#8220;extra point&#8220; which is a lot like a field goal (but worth 1 point).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the poll, each person is given two randomly selected digits, which represent the units digit of each team's score after each quarter.&nbsp; Whoever's digits match the actuall score at the end of each quarter, wins a share of the pot.)</FONT></P>
