Ya'know the song "Carry On, Our Wayward Son" by Kansas?  OK, if you're under 35 you probably don't but it was a hit in 1976.  Anyway,  the opening lines of it are: 
 
 > **Once I rose above the noise and confusion.   
 > Just to get a glimpse of *Honest Illusion***
 
Except they aren't.  That's merely what I *thought* they were singing.  It actually goes like this:

>  **Once I rose above the noise and confusion   
>  Just to get a glimpse *beyond the illusion***


(You can hear a bit of the song --- right up to just before the critical phrase-- and even buy the album (*Leftoverture*) it if you like, on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JA2B/njtheatercom-20/) )

So, eventually -- sometime in the mid'80's or so-- I finally figured out the correct lyrics. Which made me think about the line I thought it was.  And it dawned on me that the concept of an "Honest Illusion" is a bit bizarre and interesting. And more importantly it was a bizarre and interesting idea that did not originate with Kerry Livgren of Kansas, but was **all mine**.

Naturally, as soon as I had an opportunity to grab up the domain name [honestillusion.com](http://www.honestillusion.com/), I did.  Then I had to think for a while to decide what to do with it.  I already had a [site](http://www.noveltheory.com/) with my resume and technical writings and stuff like that, so it just sat in my collection of unused domains, until I thought about creating a Blog, and the name just seemed a natural for it.
