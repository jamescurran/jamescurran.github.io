Ya'know the song "Carry On, Our Wayward Son" by Kansas?  OK, if you're under 35 you probably don't but it was a hit in 1976 .  Anyway,  the opening lines of it are: 
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><font color="#800080">Once I rose above the noise and confusion<br />Just to get a glimpse of <em>Honest Illusion</em></font></strong> </li></ul>
<p><font size="+0">Except they aren't.  That's merely what I <em>thought </em>they were singing.  It actually goes like this:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><font color="#800080">Once I rose above the noise and confusion<br />Just to get a glimpse <em>beyond the illusion</em></font></strong> </li></ul>
<p><font size="+0">(You can hear a bit of the song --- right up to just before the critical phrase-- and even buy the album (<em>Leftoverture</em>) it if you like, on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JA2B/njtheatercom-20/">Amazon</a> )</font> </p>
<p>So, eventually -- sometime in the mid'80's or so-- I finally figured out the correct lyrics. Which made me think about the line I thought it was.  And it dawned on me that the concept of an "Honest Illusion" is a bit bizarre and interesting. And more importantly it was a bizarre and interesting idea that did <em>not</em> originate with Kerry Livgren of Kansas, but was <strong>all mine</strong>. </p>
<p>Naturally, as soon as I had an opportunity to grab up the domain name <a href="http://www.honestillusion.com/">honestillusion.com</a>, I did.  Then I had to think for a while to decide what to do with it.  I already had a <a href="http://www.noveltheory.com/">site </a>with my resume and technical writings and stuff like that, so it just sat in my collection of unused domains, until I thought about creating a Blog, and the name just seemed a natural for it. </p>
