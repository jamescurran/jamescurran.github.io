      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">The tax plan itself has several facets:<br />Removal of the "Marriage penalty" -- Almost a total non-issue. The "Married, filing jointly" option was designed for the "traditional" family, where the father made most of the money and the mother made little or nothing. If both made significant income, they got screwed on the deal --- which they invented the "Married, filing separately" option years ago. This change is mostly for couples too lazy to file separately. (Note that it mostly helps DINKs and not the real working class)</font>
    </font>

    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Then there's the increase in the deductions for children. This is a purely good idea. It helps those that need it, who happen to be those mostly likely to spend the money in a way that will help the economy. (This almost had to be the Democrats contribution to the plan....)</font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Finally, there's the keystone of the plan, the dividend tax cut. This is an <em>INCREDIBLY</em> bad idea, because, it's intended purpose is to create new jobs, and it hasn't a chance in hell of succeeding. Let me explain.</font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">The President's plan goes like this: </font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <font size="2">
        <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">With lower tax, more companies will offer dividends.</font>
      </font>
    </li>
    <li>
      <font size="2">
        <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Now, with some extra cash from their dividends, small business owners will rush out and hire workers for their small businesses, moving the economy along.</font>
      </font>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">So, what's wrong with this  <strong>Everything!</strong></font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Why would companies be more willing to offer dividends just because the recipients will get to keep more of it  What's is it to them  OK, the tax cut might encourage more people to invest to dividend offering company, raising their stock, which might encourage more companies to offer them, so he's not completely off the mark here ---but this is not really a good thing, as we'll get to in a moment.<br />The next step in this scheme jumps to "small business owner", as if they are the only ones likely to benefit from this. Actually, they are the least likely.</font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <font size="2">
        <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Most dividend producing stock is owned by mutual funds. </font>
      </font>
    </li>
    <li>
      <font size="2">
        <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Most shares of mutual funds are owned by middle-class people -- but for their retirement accounts, where they have no effect on the current economy, and aren't taxed anyway. The next largest group of mutual fund owners are the very rich.</font>
      </font>
    </li>
    <li>
      <font size="2">
        <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Similar, the next largest group of stock holders is also the very rich -- founders of major corporations and their heirs, and their corporate executives. None of these people are in a position to use a few extra dollars in their personal pocket to hire additional people (except possible household servants)</font>
      </font>
    </li>
    <li>
      <font size="2">
        <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Finally, some really tiny percentage of this money goes into the pockets of small business owners (the very few that didn't liquidate their stock holdings to raise funds to start the business)</font>
      </font>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">But these people will be using it to hire new workers right <br />Well, No... almost certainly not.... Think about it.... </font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Say you run a struggling business and suddenly you get, say, an extra $10,000 dollars from your stock investments ($10,000 is ridiculously high for this amount, but we'll go with it). Now what would your thoughts be </font>

      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">I'm guessing that (A) and (B) come to you long before (C) does. The big problem here is that it expects the money to cross the gulf between "personal assets" and "company assets". If their company's already on the ropes, not many will throw "good money after bad"</font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">The basic idea here (as with most of the completely discredited, but still widely favored by Republicans, "trickle down theory") is that companies hire people out of charity -- they have a couple extra bucks, so why not hire some people.</font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">This, of course, is nonsense. Companies hire workers when they need workers. If you want to create jobs, you must create the need for jobs. </font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">Which is the next reason why this plan is disastrous. For kick start a sluggish economy, <em>money must be spent</em>. The idea of a tax cut is that if the people have more money to spend, they will go out and spend it. On the whole, a good idea, but it overlooks a very important point -- the economy doesn't care who's spending the money. It could be people, or the government. It doesn't matter, as long as <em>money is spent</em>. The point is, that if you have to cut government spending to pay for the tax cut you've completely negated the effect of the tax cut itself, which is exactly what Bush has done.</font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">So, what would work </font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" face="Garamond" size="3">We must increase to total amount spend in the economy. This means to increase government spending plus increase the amount of money available to those who have none to spend now. A tax cut won't work, because, even if properly targeted (fat chance under a Republican administration) would necessitate reduced spending. So, we need to raise the minimum wage. This increases the spending money for the common worker, PLUS increases tax revenue. Ignore the myth that it increases layoffs --- again, this is based on the faulty notion that companies hire expendable workers as charity (which they let go when they get too expensive). Nonsense, companies hire the workers they need. If a company needs workers it can't afford to pay, then it's mismanaged, and should go out of business.</font>
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="2">
      <font color="#000000" size="3">
        <font face="Garamond">Next, we could try putting this "hire workers as charity" thing the Republicans insist happens, into practice. To do this, we must encourage companies to spend whatever extra cash they have on hand to hire new workers, instead of wasting it on, say, paying dividends!. In other words, we should be making the divided tax rate as <strong>high as possible!</strong></font>
