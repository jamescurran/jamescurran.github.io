title: Dishonest Illusion.
---
<p>Well, a couple years ago,  when I first thought about getting the domain, honestillusion.com, I naturally first checked to see if anyone else was using the domain (which no one was), or using the term at all --- and to my surprise -- someone was.</p>
<p>It seems that one of romance writer <a href="http://www.noraroberts.com/">Nora Roberts</a>'s books is entitled <em>Honest Illusions.  </em>Now, that was first published in 1992, and my claim to the term, as I've previously explained, goes back to 1976, so I'm still calling dibbs on it --- but if she want to use the term to sell some books, I'm cool with that (mainly because I'm sure she can afford better lawyers than I can, and afterall, it was eleven years ago....)</p>
<p>Now, if you came here looking for information about Ms. Roberts's book, you've come to the wrong place. But you can buy the book here:</p><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?o=1&amp;l=as1&amp;f=ifr&amp;t=njtheatercom-20&amp;p=8&amp;asins=0515110973&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank" frameborder="0" width="120" scrolling="no" height="240"><map name="boxmap-p8"><area shape="RECT" coords="14, 200, 103, 207" href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html?o=1" /><area coords="0,0,10000,10000" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/njtheatercom-20" /></map><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/120x240.gif" width="120" height="240" border="0" usemap="#boxmap-p8" alt="Shop at Amazon.com" /></iframe>
