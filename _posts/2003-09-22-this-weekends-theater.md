I just remember that I added a "Theater" category, but I keep forgetting to use it.   This past weekend, I was:

**Thurs:** "Pterodactyls" - Theater Project in Cranford.

**Fri:** "La Cage aux Folles" - 4th Wall Musical Theater in Morristown.

**Sat:** "Noises Off!" - Villagers Theater in Somerset. (And the first one whose title I didn't have to look up the spelling of)

**Sun:** "A Midsummer's Night Dream" - Circle Playhouse in Piscataway. (The only place that made me pay --- and they usually comp me as well, it just depends on who's working the box office that day)
