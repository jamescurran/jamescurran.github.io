<SPAN class=spnMessageText id=msg><FONT color=#191970 size=2>Sorry, I guess I left you hanging there.....<BR><BR>Sunday, we had the final performance, "Harriet" by the Serenity Players of Washington, DC. Originally a one-women monologue about Harriet Tubman, they added a second woman, who performed a couple hymns (Tubman was given the talk at a church revivial meeting, so it worked).<BR><BR>After that we broke for lunch, and started hanidcapping the race. Most felt that "Fin &amp; Euba" was in the lead. I felt "Harriet" should be second, and either "Art" or "The Daughter-in-law" third, but the adjudicators seemed to like "Double Date", so it might sneak in. In other words, I'd eliminated "The Curtain Call of the Wild", and thought everything else had a chance.<BR><BR>So, who did win what?<BR><BR>Excellence in Costumes: "Daughter-in-law" (NJ)<BR>Excellence in Costumes: "The Curtain Call of the Wild" (DE)<BR>Excellence in Costumes: "Harriet" (DC)<BR><BR>Excellence in Set Dressing: "Daughter-in-law" (NJ)<BR>Excellence in Makeup: "Daughter-in-law" (NJ)<BR><BR>Excellence in Sound: "Fin &amp; Euba" (MD)<BR>Excellence in Scenary:"Fin &amp; Euba" (MD)<BR>Excellence in Technical Design:"Fin &amp; Euba" (MD)<BR>Excellence in Direction:"Fin &amp; Euba" (MD)<BR>Excellence in Orginal Script: "Fin &amp; Euba" (Audrey Cefaly)<BR><BR>Excellence in Ensemble Timing: "Double Date" (NY)<BR><BR>Excellence in Ensemble Acting: "The Curtain Call of the Wild" (DE)<BR><BR>Excellence in Acting:<BR>Erika Imhoof (Euba) "Fin &amp; Euba"<BR>Audrey Cefaly (Fin) "Fin &amp; Euba"<BR>Marlene C.
