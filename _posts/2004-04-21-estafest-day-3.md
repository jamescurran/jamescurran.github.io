Sorry, I guess I left you hanging there.....

Sunday, we had the final performance, "*Harriet*" by the Serenity Players of Washington, DC. Originally a one-women monologue about Harriet Tubman, they added a second woman, who performed a couple hymns (Tubman was given the talk at a church revival meeting, so it worked).

After that we broke for lunch, and started handicapping the race. Most felt that "Fin &amp; Euba" was in the lead. I felt "Harriet" should be second, and either "Art" or "The Daughter-in-Law" third, but the adjudicators seemed to like "Double Date", so it might sneak in. In other words, I'd eliminated "The Curtain Call of the Wild", and thought everything else had a chance.

So, who did win what ?
