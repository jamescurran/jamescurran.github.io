<P>OK, I don't mean that in the sense &#8220;...if Bush is re-elected..&#8221;</P>
<P>No, this goes deeper than the election.....</P>
<P>Yesterday, I saw an &#8220;Washington Power Players&#8220; Edition of Jeopardy (It may have been a re-run from earlier in the season).  The players were Tim Russert (Host of NBC's Meet the Press), Christie Todd-Whitman (Fmr Governor of NJ & Fmr Secry of the EPA), and Tavis Smiley (Host of NPR's Tavis Smiley show).</P>
<P>The Final Jeopardy question was (paraphrased) &#8220;How many US Senators were there in 1958 &#8220;</P>
<P>Now, there are <STRONG>two</STRONG> Senators from each state, and presently, we have <STRONG>50 </STRONG>states.  Hence, we currently have <STRONG>100</STRONG> Senators.</P>
<P>So, all one has to do to answer this, is to remember that Alaska & Hawaii became states in 1959, which means in 1958, we had two fewer states, which means 4 fewer Senators, and then sunbstract <STRONG>4 </STRONG>from <STRONG>100</STRONG> to get <STRONG>96</STRONG>.    That's it!</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>All three got it wrong!</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Has mathematics education in the US declined so badly that the simple equation &#8220;<STRONG>100 - 4 = 96</STRONG>&#8220;  eludes three prominent and seemly intelligent people </P>
