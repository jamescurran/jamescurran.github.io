Ok, so, I've been a bit lax about writing this blog.  Hey, it's not like people was hanging around wait for my next report.  We all know this is just for some future researcher writing a biography of me years from now, after I win a Nobel Prize or something.

Anyway,  Theater.  I remember on the Weekend of Nov 6<sup>th</sup> through 9<sup>th</sup>, I saw 5 plays in four days.  The only two that made my calendar were *Othello* at the Shakespeare Theater of NJ, and *Jane Eyre: the Musical* at Circle Playhouse.  I'm better sure that was also the weekend I saw "*Two on the Aisle, Three in the Van*" by Mary Lyn Dobson at Playhouse 22 -- an extremely funny play about community theater.  Now, I'm pretty sure I saw "*Perchance to Dream*" at Alliance Rep Thursday.  I think that leaves just the Saturday evening show still a mystery.

The next weekend, *Over the River and Through the Woods* (Friday -- it was sold out, so I was in the "standing room" which is actually a bar stool in the back), at the Nutley Little Theater, *The Four Doctors Huxley*, (Saturday) at the Attic Ensemble in Jersey City, and *Noises Off!* -- one of the funniest plays ever written, at Perriot Production.

Also, and Saturday morning &amp; afternoon, I attended a "Mini-MVP Summit" sponsored by Microsoft, just for it's [MVPs](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/). Lot's of demos of what's going -- sort of the marketing version of the PDC.

And Sunday Morning, I attended the meeting of the [NJ Theater League](http://www.njtl.net).
