<p>Ok, so, I've been a bit lax about writing this blog.  Hey, it's not like people was hanging around wait for my next report.  We all know this is just for some future researcher writing a biography of me years from now, after I win a Nobel Prize or something.</p>
<p>Anyway,  Theater.  I remember on the Weekend of Nov 6<sup>th</sup> through 9<sup>th</sup>, I saw 5 plays in four days.  The only two that made my calendar were <em>Othello</em> at the Shakespeare Theater of NJ, and <em>Jane Eyre the Musical</em> at Circle Playhouse.  I'm better sure that was also the weekend I saw “<em>Two on the Aisle, Three in the Van</em>” by Mary Lyn Dobson at Playhouse 22 -- an extermely funny play about community theater.  Now, I'm pretty sure I saw “<em>Perchance to Dream</em>” at Alliance Rep Thursday.  I think that leaves just the Saturday evening show still a mystery.</p>
<p>The next weekend, <em>Over the River and Through the Woods </em>(Friday -- it was sold out, so I was in the “standing room“ which is actually a bar stool in the back), at the Nutley Little Theater, <em>The Four Doctors Huxley</em>, (Saturday) at the Attic Ensemble in Jersey City, and <em>Noises Off!</em> -- one of the funniest plays ever written, at Perriot Production.</p>
<p>Also, and Saturday morning &amp; afternoon, I attended a “Mini-MVP Summit“ sponsored by Microsoft, just for it's <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/">MVPs</a>. Lot's of demos of what's going -- sort of the marketing version of the PDC.</p>
<p>And Sunday Morning, I attended the meeting of the <a href="http://www.njtl.net">NJ Theater League</a>.</p>
