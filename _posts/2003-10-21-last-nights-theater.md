<p>Let's see if I can actually make it up to three posts in two day!</p>
<p>Last night, I attended a play read, "Savage in Limbo" by John Patrick Shanley.  Shanley is probably best known as the write of the movie "<em>Moonstruck</em>" which won him (as well as Cher) an Oscar, and gave some buzz to his next efforts "<em>The January Man</em>" and "<em>Joe vs. the Volcano</em>".  The only plays I've seen by him are this and "Welcome to the Moon".  Both of these take place in bars in the Bronx.  "<em>Moon</em>" is mostly men, and this one is mostly women.  Also, just about all the characters in both plays (as with <em>Moonstruck</em>) are Italian, which seems a bit odd from an author with a very Irish name. </p>
<p>After the reading (it was fully staged &amp; blocked, although with a minimal set, and only a rough estimation of costuming --- I'm guessing that the actors just grabbed something close out of their closets), there was a discussion with the audience --- The general feeling was that it was a interesting character study, but none of the characters was really likable, giving the audience nothing really to hold on to.</p>
