Let's see if I can actually make it up to three posts in two day!

Last night, I attended a play read, "Savage in Limbo" by John Patrick Shanley.  Shanley is probably best known as the writer of the movie "*Moonstruck*" which won him (as well as Cher) an Oscar, and gave some buzz to his next efforts "*The January Man*" and "*Joe vs. the Volcano*".  The only plays I've seen by him are this and *Welcome to the Moon*.  Both of these take place in bars in the Bronx.

"*...Moon*" is mostly men, and this one is mostly women.  Also, just about all the characters in both plays (as with *Moonstruck*) are Italian, which seems a bit odd from an author with a very Irish name. 

After the reading (it was fully staged &amp; blocked, although with a minimal set, and only a rough estimation of costuming --- I'm guessing that the actors just grabbed something close out of their closets), there was a discussion with the audience --- The general feeling was that it was a interesting character study, but none of the characters was really likable, giving the audience nothing really to hold on to.
