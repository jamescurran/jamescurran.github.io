I live in NJ, and last year (and half of this year -- but that's another story) I worked in New York State (Manhattan to be precise).  This meant that back in April, in addition to the Federal tax return, I also had to file returns for both NY & NJ.  I used TaxCut (Sooo much better that TurboTax), which has the interesting quirk of only allowing you to file one state return electronically.

So, I had to mail the NYS return.  I made one small mistake  --- I forgot to include my W-2 form.  (As it is impossible to include the form with the electronically filed returns, I just forgot about it).  Apparently, New York State took offense to this, and sent me a letter complaining about "a problem" with the return (It did take a bit of figuring to determine the problem was the missing W-2).  But at the time I had bigger problems (It's related to why I'm not working in NYC anymore), and, since I was getting a refund anyway, I wasn't too concerned about it, and put it off for a while (and I still had to *find* my W-2 form).
 
Apparently, NY State doesn't like being ignored.  They sent me a letter claiming that I owed them $4400!   Reviewing the letter, it included a summary of my tax return --- exact as I had filed it, with one exception --- they did not acknowledge that I had had any money withheld from my paycheck to pay the state tax.   I returned the letter (with the "Dispute" box checked) including a new copy of my return *with* the W-2.
 
But, I did find it interesting that the *one line* of my tax return that they chose not to believe was the one line that they *knew for a fact* was correct --- the amount of money I had already paid them.
