  <p>Apparently, on a scale of 0 - 40, <a href="http://franz.org/quiz.htm">measuring how much of a conservative/Republican</a> one is, I scored an 11% (which I guess is "average liberal")</p> <p>However, afterward, I checked the Javascript source and found it's a bit funky.  Basically, everyone starts with a 0, and gets a point for each "conservative" answer they give.</p> <p>But, serveral are "choose all that apply" answers, and they aren't handled quite right.  For example, #5, has six available choices.  If you choose the one "conservative" answer, ("none of the above") you get a conservative point.  It doesn't matter what combination of the other five you chose.  Choosing one or all five make you equally liberal in this quiz, which is not right.</p>
