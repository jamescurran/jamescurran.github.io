title: The Dumbest Christmas Tradition
---

  <p>Merry Christmas.</p> <p>Attending midnight mass last night, (message delayed a bit due to technical difficulties) I was reminded of what is clearly one of the dumbest Christmas traditions practiced by many.   Many (probably most) Christians will display a nativity scene along with their Christmas decorations, and (here's the dumb part) a large number of them won't put the baby Jesus into the creche until Christmas morning.   "It's only logical" they protest.  "Jesus wasn't born until Christmas" --- Yeah, but where exactly is the logic in having a scene of Mary, Joseph and a bunch of shepherds looking adoringly at an empty manger?</p>
