<p>I'm a bit behind on this, aren't I?</p>
<p>Friday: <em>Joseph &amp; The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, </em>at Smiling Rhino Production, in Pompton Lakes.  I Reviewed this for RECT, so I'm not allowed to talk about it.</p>
<p>Saturday:  After a last minute change of plans, <em>Dracula</em>, at Brundage Park Playhouse.  This is a new adaptation, by Steven Dietz.  I'd seen his <em>Private Eyes</em>, at 12 Miles West so time ago, and was looking forward to his take on the story.  It is said to be closer to the original Bran Stoker novel than any other adaptation.  Having never read the book, I'll have to take their word for it.  It is, nevertheless, a very good adaptation, and a very good production -- sufficently creepy.  One thing that interested me about the adaptation is that, unlike other recent versions, the playwright didn't downplay the religious aspects of the fight with the vampire.  I wonder if this reflects Dietz's own feeling, or just an desire to stay close to the source material.</p>
