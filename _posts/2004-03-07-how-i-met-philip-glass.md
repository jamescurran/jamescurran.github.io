title: How I met Philip Glass
---
<P>Some time ago, Raymond Chen blogged about the <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/04/67385.aspx">Glass Engine</A>, and asked&nbsp;<A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/marcmill">Marc Miller</A> to tell the story of how he met Philip Glass. It appears that Marc never did, so I'll post my story.</P>
<P>Actually, it's not very exciting.&nbsp; Circa 1989, he was doing a concert tour, playing some of his compositions on solo piano.&nbsp; One stop was at the McCarter Theater (part of Princeton University).&nbsp; After the show, as I was leaving, I bumped into a friend, who worked there.&nbsp; He said he was about to head backstage to ask Glass to autograph a CD of his, and would I like to come.&nbsp; I said sure, and he lead the way.&nbsp; I got him to sign my program, and asked if there was going to be a production of &#8220;The Making of the Representative for Planet 8&#8221; any time soon.&nbsp; (It had premiered in Houston the year before, and then pretty much disappeared -- still haven't been recorded).&nbsp; He said that there may be one in NYC in the next year, but I never heard anything about it.</P>
<P>However, I have a better story of a similar vein.&nbsp; For many years, I've attended the Brooklyn Academy of Music's &#8220;Next Wave&#8221; festival.&nbsp; (Buying a ticket to their first production of Glass &amp; Robert Wilson's &#8220;Einstein on the Beach&#8221; was the very first thing I did after landing a job after being graduated from college).&nbsp;&nbsp; Since BAM is a 50 miles round for me, I normally get a subscription with mostly Sunday matin&#233;es performance.&nbsp; One year, my subscription include one Saturday evening performance -- For Robert Wilson's &#8220;the CIVIL warS&#8221; (with music by Glass)-- opening night as it turned out.&nbsp; It was also the Saturday before Christmas, and lower Manhattan was in gridlock, so I arrived about 45 minutes late.&nbsp; I was directed to the standing room section with the other late comers and was told I'd be seated when the first act ended. My view was blocked by a very tall man in the front of the standee, and I was just about to ask him to move to the rear, when the act ended.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then someone walked up to the very tall man and said, &#8220;Great show, Bob&#8221;, at which point I realized that the very tall man was the playwright, Robert Wilson.</P>
<P>Two more quick ones:&nbsp;&nbsp; At a performance of &#8220;1000 Airplanes on the Roof&#8221;&nbsp; (Directed, and with music by, Philip Glass), directly behind me was Peter <SPAN class=hed>Schickele (aka, PDQ Bach).&nbsp; And, at a concert by Meredith Monk, a few rows away was Laurie Anderson.&nbsp; As we were filing out into the aisles to leave after the show, she ended up right next to me, so I was able to say hello, and that I was a big fan.</SPAN></P>
