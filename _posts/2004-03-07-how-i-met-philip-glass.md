Some time ago, Raymond Chen blogged about the [Glass Engine](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/04/67385.aspx), and asked [Marc Miller](http://weblogs.asp.net/marcmill) to tell the story of how he met Philip Glass. It appears that Marc never did, so I'll post my story.

Actually, it's not very exciting.  Circa 1989, he was doing a concert tour, playing some of his compositions on solo piano.  One stop was at the McCarter Theater (part of Princeton University).  After the show, as I was leaving, I bumped into a friend, who worked there. He said he was about to head backstage to ask Glass to autograph a CD of his, and would I like to come.  I said sure, and he led the way. I got him to sign my program, and asked if there was going to be a production of &#8220;*The Making of the Representative for Planet 8*&#8221; any time soon.  (It had premiered in Houston the year before, and then pretty much disappeared -- it still hasn't been recorded).  He said that there may be one in NYC in the next year, but I never heard anything about it.

However, I have a better story of a similar vein.  For many years, I've attended the Brooklyn Academy of Music's &#8220;Next Wave&#8221; festival.  (Buying a ticket to their first production of Glass &amp; Robert Wilson's &#8220;*Einstein on the Beach*&#8221; was the very first thing I did after landing a job after being graduated from college).  Since BAM is a 50 miles round for me, I normally get a subscription with mostly Sunday matin&#233;es performance.  One year, my subscription include one Saturday evening performance -- For Robert Wilson's &#8220;*the CIVIL warS*&#8221; (with music by Glass)-- opening night as it turned out.  It was also the Saturday before Christmas, and lower Manhattan was in gridlock, so I arrived about 45 minutes late.  I was directed to the standing room section with the other late comers and was told I'd be seated when the first act ended. My view was blocked by a very tall man in the front of the standees, and I was just about to ask him to move to the rear, when the act ended.  Just then someone walked up to the very tall man and said, &#8220;Great show, Bob&#8221;, at which point I realized that the very tall man was the playwright, Robert Wilson.

Two more quick ones: At a performance of &#8220;*1000 Airplanes on the Roof*&#8221; (Directed, and with music by, Philip Glass), directly behind me was Peter Schickele (aka, PDQ Bach).  And, at a concert by Meredith Monk, a few rows away was Laurie Anderson. As we were filing out into the aisles to leave after the show, she ended up right next to me, so I was able to say hello, and that I was a big fan.
