I think I saw Sarah Jessica Parker on the street yesterday.&nbsp; 
<P>I was walking down 23rd St in NYC, from 6 th Ave (heading towards 5th Ave).&nbsp; A woman was walking the other way. I didn't think anything of it, as people pass all the time, but just as she passed me, she took off her sunglasses to read a sign in a store window.&nbsp; In the split second before went out of my line of sight, the flash of recognition hit me.&nbsp; I glanced back, but no wanting to look like a stalker I kept walking in my direction, so for the second look, she was further away and turned away from me, so I still really can't say for sure if it was her.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now, if the Map to the Movie Stars' Homes I bought about a decade ago is to be believed, she &amp; her family live about 15 blocks south of that spot, and according to IMDB, she's in a film which is currently shooting in Madison NJ.&nbsp; That's less than an hour outside the City, so she would probably be stay at her home and commuting out there when she's needed.&nbsp; So, while I can't be sure it was her, I also having found anything to prove it couldn't have been.....</P>
