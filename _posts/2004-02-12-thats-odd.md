<P>I'm back.....</P>
<P>The website was down about almost a week.&nbsp; (Did you miss us?&nbsp; I'd make the obvious joke about &#8220;all my regular reader -- both of you&#8221;, except even that is hopelessly optimitic -- but those of you who last week tried to do a Google search of Kansas lyrics and came up with a 404 error, we're back, now.</P>
<P>Actually, the site itself came back online last Wednesday [long boring techinical details of what went wrong skipped], but from some reason, it wouldn't let me in to add new entries.&nbsp; (I could log on as admin and do other stuff, just not write new entries).&nbsp; Anyway, that problem disappears as mysteriously as it came, so here I am.</P>
