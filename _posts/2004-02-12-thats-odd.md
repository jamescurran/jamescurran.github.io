<P>I'm back.....</P>
<P>The website was down about almost a week.  (Did you miss us   I'd make the obvious joke about &#8220;all my regular reader -- both of you&#8221;, except even that is hopelessly optimitic -- but those of you who last week tried to do a Google search of Kansas lyrics and came up with a 404 error, we're back, now.</P>
<P>Actually, the site itself came back online last Wednesday [long boring techinical details of what went wrong skipped], but from some reason, it wouldn't let me in to add new entries.  (I could log on as admin and do other stuff, just not write new entries).  Anyway, that problem disappears as mysteriously as it came, so here I am.</P>
