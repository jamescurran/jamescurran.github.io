<P>Ok, so this is blantant Google-bait, but my treatise on Britney's breast isn't getting that many hits lately.</P>
<P>Anyway, I've heard various reasons why girl-on-girl sex scenes are so interesting to men.&nbsp; For example, some would argue that these excite men, because they seek the challenge of &#8220;converting&#8220; the women, while gay porn threatens their sense of manhood.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have a simplier theory:&nbsp; <EM>Count the Naked Woman.</EM></P>
<P>Gay Porn: Zero naked woman - zero male interest.</P>
<P>Conventional (male/female) porn: One naked woman - significant male interest.</P>
<P>Lesbian Porn: Two naked woman - extreme male interest.</P>
<P>How difficult was that???</P>
