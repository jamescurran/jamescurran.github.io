Ok, so this is blantant Google-bait, but my treatise on Britney's breast isn't getting that many hits lately.

Anyway, I've heard various reasons why girl-on-girl sex scenes are so interesting to men.  For example, some would argue that these excite men, because they seek the challenge of &#8220;converting&#8220; the women, while gay porn threatens their sense of manhood.

I have a simplier theory:  *Count the Naked Woman.*

 * Gay Porn: Zero naked woman - zero male interest.
 * Conventional (male/female) porn: One naked woman - significant male interest.
 * Lesbian Porn: Two naked woman - extreme male interest.
 
How difficult was that?
