<p>Casara Ruth Sexaur was born yesterday (Saturday) 13-Sep-2003 at 10:06am. Weighing 7lb6oz, and standing (well, lying) 1 ft 9 3/4 inchs tall, making me a uncle for (depending on how you count) the first or ninth time.</p>
<p>I took photos, but with my film camera, so we'll have to wait until I get them developed.</p>
