<p>This probably should be included as part of the “back-fill” since it relates to something that happened last week, but I'm figuring no one is actually going to read anything but the new stuff, so I'll dated it today.</p>
<p>Anyway, last weekend I was in Cape Cod.  On Saturday, I went to see a play in New Bedford, MA (on the mainland, just south of the Cape), and on the way back to my stepmother house (where I was staying), a thunderstorm started --- Lots of rain, and lots of “sheet” lightning.</p>
<p>"Sheet" lightning (also known as "heat" lightning) is a flash that fills sky, and usually without audible thunder.  Actually, it just regular lightening, it's just further away from the viewer, and the light is more diffused.</p>
<p>So, when I finally got home and was getting ready for bed, I open the shades on the window so I see the flashes of lightening, 'cause it was a good show.   This reminded me of another misheard lyric.</p>
<p>In the song "Okie From Muskogee" (The only version I'm familiar with is the Phil Ochs version from his album "<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000008J32/njtheatercom-20">Gunfight at Carnegie Hall</a></em>"), there a line:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where Lightning's still the biggest thrill of all</em></li></ul>
<p>Basically say “You big city folks can keep your fancy fireworks -- here we enjoy nature's light show”</p>
<p>But it just sound that way when Ochs sings it.  If you listen real closely, it turns out what he's actually singing is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>White Lightning's still the biggest thrill of all</em></li></ul>
<p>In other words, it means “You big city folks can keep your fancy marijuana ---here, we get plastered on our own home-made hooch“.</p>
<p>Like “Honest Illusion“, I kind of like my version better, and, now, it's given me something to replace “A Demo Blog“ as the subtitle this website.</p>
