Today, I was at a Italian resturant, and was wondering "What, exactly, is Bolognese sause?" 
So, being the properly wired guy, I pulled out my cell phone to take advantage of Google's SMS server : I sent a message saying "define Bolognese" to 46646 ("GOOGL").

And, as promised, within minutes, Google text-messaged me back with the definition --- *In Italian!*

(For the record, [Bolognese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolognese_sauce) means "In the style from the city of Bologna", which is to say, "with meat", as opposed to [Marinara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinara_sauce) ("Sailor Style"), which is just tomatoes and herbs.
