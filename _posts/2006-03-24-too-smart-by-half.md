  <P>Today, I was at a Italian resturant, and was wondering "What, exactly, is Bolognese sause?" </P>
<P>So, being the properly wired guy, I pulled out my cell phone to take advantage of Google's SMS server : I sent a message saying "define Bolognese" to 46646 ("GOOGL").</P>
<P>And, as promised, within minutes, Google text-messaged me back with the definition --- <EM>In Italian!</EM></P>
<P>(For the record, [wikipedia:Bolognese] means "In the style from the city of Bologna", which is to say, "with meat", as opposed to [wikipedia:Marinara] ("Sailor Style" ?), which is just tomatos and herbs.</P>
