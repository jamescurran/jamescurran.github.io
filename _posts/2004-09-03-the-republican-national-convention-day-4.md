Not as many photos today, partial because what I did wasn't as photogenic, but mostly because, for the second time in three days, I let the battery on my camera run down.

Since I got to bed later last night, I overslept and had to scramble to get into work at all. Normally I take a 9am train --- Thursday I missed the 10:30 train. 

Took a late lunch to visit Union Sq Park, cuz at 2PM, a group called the [Greene Dragon](http://www.greenedragon.net) (named after the tavern the Boston Tea Party was planned in) were having a reading on their updated Declaration of Independence,  with a very large copy for people to sign. Also in the park, were the Vietnam Veterans for Peace.
