I finally got around to uploading the digital photos I took of the events at the World Trade Center site on 11 Sept 2003. (see the image gallery at the left)   It's a really cheap digital camera, so the photos are lacking.   I took these on my lunch hour, at 1pm.  (Most of the official ceremonies run 8am-11am)
