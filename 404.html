<h1>Ooops......</h1>

You stumbled upon an dead URL at HonestIllusion.com <br/>

I've recently changed blogging host & platform  & other stuff, so a lot of old URL don't  work any more.<br/>

<h1>But DONT Panic!</h1>

The articles are still here ! (Many even have the typos fixed!)<br/>

If the link was in the form:<br/>

http://honestillusion.com/blogs/blog_0/archive/2008/01/15/article-name-here.aspx<br/>

try changing it to:<br/>

http://honestillusion.com/blog/2008/01/15/article-name-here.html<br/>

<ul>
<li>"blogs" to "blog"</li>
<li>Delete "blog_0/archive/"</li>
<li>"aspx" to "html"</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>If that doesn't work, try the <a href="archives.html">archive</a>.</h2>
